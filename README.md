====================

## Installation

### Requirements

* Make sure you have [`node`](http://nodejs.org/) installed, which comes with `npm`
* You'll need [`ruby`](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and the SASS gem to compile `SASS`
* Install `gulp` globally. This can be done by typing `npm install -g gulp` in a terminal.

### Installation

1. Clone repository from github
2. `$ npm install`

## Usage

Run the development environment by going to the project directory in a terminal and typing:

`gulp`

That's it. `Ctrl-c` to quit the process.

## Pattern Library Documentation

See [the README in source/patterns](source/patterns).

## Troubleshooting

Having trouble running the `gulp` command?

* Make sure you're in the project's root directory.
* Try running `npm install` (sometimes we add new node packages to the project's requirements as we go).
