## Installation

### Requirements

You'll need a few things installed before you can run the project locally:

* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/): `gem install sass`
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/): `npm install -g gulp`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub
2. `cd` to the project directory
3. Run `npm install`

## Usage

Run the development environment by going to the project directory in a terminal and typing:

```
gulp
```

That's it! A local webserver will start (it should open in your default browser), and will remain open as long as you'd like. Changes to source files should automatically refresh the page in your browser.

To quit the process, tap `ctrl`+`c` with your terminal focused.

## Pattern Library Documentation

See [the README in source/patterns](source/patterns).

## Troubleshooting

Having trouble running the `gulp` command?

* Make sure you're in the project's root directory.
* Try running `npm install` (sometimes we add new node packages to the project's requirements as we go).
