  <h4>Example of an Unacceptable Review:</h4>
  <blockquote>
    Last week I talked to Destiny and she told me my boyfriend Bob was cheating on me with my best friend Sally. But Star told me he was in New York from November 5 to 20, so he couldn’t have been with Sally. I hope Star is right.

  <h4>Example of an Acceptable Review:</h4>
  <blockquote>
    Star picked up on my situation right away. I hope she’s right about my boyfriend being faithful, because a different psychic told me he was cheating. Star knew things about him that no one could possibly know, so she was able to put my mind at ease.
